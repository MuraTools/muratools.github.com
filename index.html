					<p>Mura Tools is the brainchild of <a href="http://stevegood.org/" target="_blank">Steve Good</a>.&nbsp; Fed up with always forgetting to increment build numbers in his Mura plugins, he began looking for ways to automate the process.&nbsp; With the help of <a href="http://www.adampresley.com" target="_blank">Adam Presley</a>, Steve created an ANT script that would increment the build number of a Mura plugin and package it up for install.&nbsp; While this was great it just didn't feel complete and polished.&nbsp; That's when Steve turned to integrating directly with Eclipse.</p>
					<p>Building Eclipse plugins was new territory for Steve and he quickly found that while the platform was powerful it was equally expansive and confusing. Despite his struggles, Mura Tools was written with three goals in mind; Make getting and installing Mura for development a breeze, create plugins faster by removing the need to create all the boilerplate code up front and finally, bring the original ANT build automation into a much easier interface to use. And build it he did.</p>
					<p>In 2011 Steve attended the first <a href="http://opencfsummit.org" target="_blank">OpenCF Summit</a>. Inspired by the experience he opened the Mura Tools source to the public, placing the future of the plugin directly in the communities hands.&nbsp; If you would like to become involved in the project please fill out the <a href="/contact/">contact form</a> and we will get you all hooked up!</p>
					<p>Thanks for using Mura Tools!</p>
